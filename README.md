## Flatdango Movie Ticketing Web App
Flatdango is a mini web application that allows users to browse and purchase movie tickets from the Flatiron Movie Theater. This project focuses on fetching movie data from a local JSON server and dynamically updating the UI based on user interactions.

### Project Overview
Flatdango provides the following functionalities to users:

 - Display details of the first movie including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets upon page load.
- View a menu of all available movies on the left side of the page.
- Purchase tickets for a movie, with the number of available tickets decreasing visibly on the frontend. Users cannot buy tickets if the showing is sold out (i.e., no available tickets remaining).
- Bonus: Click on a movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's details with the selected movie's details.
- Bonus: Indicate when a movie is sold out by changing the button text to "Sold Out" and adding a sold-out class to the film item in the menu.
